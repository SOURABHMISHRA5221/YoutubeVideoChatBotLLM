[APPLAUSE]
>> Now Punk with McIntyre up on his shoulders. >> Could they think about going to sleep,
McIntyre wisely grasping the cell. >> Exits in the world talking about Hell
in a Cell as we kick off the night Tonight inside this structure with McIntyre and
Punk, claymore, claymore, claymore by McIntyre,
driving Punk to the floor. >> [APPLAUSE] >> Punk is physically maimed, exhausted, beaten. >> And a toolbox to the face of McIntyre,
and suddenly Punk's got a chance. Toolbox in hand, using it as a weapon and
unloading on McIntyre. >> We had to break out
The Muta Scale pretty soon as Punk makes the climb to the top,
turnbuckle, toolbox in hand. >> McIntyre can't see, trying to wipe
the blood, and again he's taken down. >> Blinded, battered, brutalized. >> [APPLAUSE] >> As intense a match as you'll ever see, McIntyre now just powering up Punk. >> God, good God. >> My God, through the table,
through the damn table. >> Punk ain't getting up. >> [INAUDIBLE] come on. >> My goodness. >> The ultimate f you
from McIntyre to Punk. >> The plastic beads, the kind of
beads that the bracelet that meant so much to CM Punk were made up, Drew McIntyre symbolically pouring
them all over the head of Punk. [INAUDIBLE] claymore, God, my God,
McIntyre, bear Punk's back. >> [APPLAUSE] >> And followed it up with a splash. >> Bayley has taken a ton of
punishment to this point. >> Now this is the pace that Nia likes,
and now she's got Bayley in position, perhaps for the annihilator,
her finishing move has taken out strong. And Bayley, though, knows it's
coming quickly back to her feet, and now Bailey countered away Nia. >> Desperately trying to chop at
the knees, the hamstrings of the champion, trying to soften up Nia Jax. >> [APPLAUSE]
>> What the hell? >> We've seen this before, Cole. >> Can she pull it off again,
she did this at SummerSlam. >> Nia top. >> Cover here for the title. >> And Nia Jax kicks out and drops Bayley right on the back of
the head of the official, Jessica Carr. >> Just incidental contact,
I think Jessica is gonna be just fine, but Nia Jax like a,
>> I don't think she's gonna be fine now. >> [APPLAUSE] >> Nia Jax falling on the official. >> And again, that was incidental,
that was not malicious from the champ, but the bottom line is
the official's out in the ring. >> And now Bayley. >> Pop-up stunner from Bayley. >> And Bayley now [INAUDIBLE] to Nia,
cover, she could have the title won but the official's down. >> Just wake up. >> Bailey at the championship won,
but the official. >> It's Tiffy time. >> It's gonna happen, it's gonna happen. >> Miss Money in the Bank heading
to the ring, Bayley though, Michin there, Tiffany Stratton
with a briefcase to Bayley. And now what does Tiffany do,
does she cash in for a Triple threat? >> Well, there's no official
to get the briefcase to. >> [INAUDIBLE] are you okay,
come on, come on. >> [APPLAUSE]
>> Now Jessica Carr now realizing the contracts in the ring as she comes to,
and, Tiffany caught red-handed. >> [APPLAUSE]
>> Double leg by Finn, bang stomp right to the chest. >> [APPLAUSE]
>> And again. >> And now Balor has taken over. >> And this is a little bit more along the
lines of what I expected from Finn, trying to chop Damian down but Priest again puts
the brakes on, hoisting Balor way up high. >> And
a gut wrench by Priest into Razor's edge, paying homage to his hero, Razor Ramon,
hook for the leg, kick out. >> [APPLAUSE]
>> Look who's here, you wonder when this was gonna happen,
Carlito with The Judgment Day. And there's JD McDonagh, Balor's Tag Team
partner, into the corner goes Priest. And Balor's gonna steal the damn match
because of McDonagh and Carlito. >> [APPLAUSE]
>> [INAUDIBLE] by Balor, cover by Finn on Priest,
Priest got the shoulder up. >> [APPLAUSE] >> And now Dominic there, looking back at her bow, suplex. Look at what's coming, looking for three amigos is Liv Morgan and
Rhea Ripley. >> The third time could be the charm and
could retain the championship for Morgan. >> Blocked by Rhea. >> Liv out the back door. >> Rhea trying to fight back into
this really on one leg at this point, trying to power Liv up. >> Come on, Liv. >> [APPLAUSE]
>> And down goes Liv, then Liv races. >> Dominic gets the door open. >> It's a miracle. >> I think he picked the lock,
did he learn that prison, what do you think he used? >> I don't know, Cole, I've never had
to pick a prison cell lock before, I've been in a shark cage. >> Now, Rhea going up to the top rope,
Morgan in trouble, Rhea Ripley up top and
now she's paying homage. >> And now she's just lusting
after Dirty Dom again. >> [APPLAUSE]
>> From the top, [INAUDIBLE] to Liv to win
the championship, hook on the leg, >> [APPLAUSE] >> And now into the other side, official Dan Engler,
allowing a lot to go in this matchup, and again, just mocking Dom. >> [APPLAUSE] [NOISE]
>> No. >> Out on the floor,
Rhea Ripley looking up at Dominik, gonna make Dominik watch the love of
his life suffer a Riptide, my God! And Dominik is helpless. [NOISE] >> And now Liv sent back into the ring. Out of the cage, no, no,
no, no, my God, God! >> God, he's trapped. [NOISE]
>> Dominik hanging from the cage. >> Somebody get some help. [NOISE]
>> With the-
>> Well, because Dom doesn't know what
it's like to be in love. >> I think the headquarters
will be reviewing that tape. As Rhea Ripley now has
a kendo stick in hand. >> [APPLAUSE]
>> No, do you know what I just thought? >> What? [NOISE]
>> What- >> What do you think about it? >> What are you thinking, Michael? What are you thinking, Cole? >> Dominik's hung up like a stuck hog. >> I was hoping that was
not what you were thinking. >> He has no idea and
he has nowhere to go. >> Because Rhea's thinking
the same damn thing. >> There's no way to get out of this. >> Hold on, hold on, hold on. >> Happy birthday to me. >> Hey. >> Here we go. >> Cover up, Dom, cover up. >> Rhea trying to knock
the stuffing out of Dominik. I didn't expect the kendo
to go flying everywhere. And Wait a minute, who the hell? [NOISE]

that. [SOUND] [NOISE]
